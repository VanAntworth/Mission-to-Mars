# Mission-to-Mars

Purpose - to assist in creating a web app using Mongo database and running through flask.

## Description

Created web app that pulls data in real time and has a polished look. Adjustable for view on different devices(mobile). Worked with website that we created in Module 10 to further add to the Mars information. Images of the four hemispheres of Mars we added. This was achieved by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, and use a web application to display the data. Used CSS Bootstra to further add details to the project. In particular - Changed color of scraping button. I also striped the data table on the webpage for better radability. (Purposely changed minor things with bootstrap as to not corrupt my code - first timer).
